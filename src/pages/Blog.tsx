      title: "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding",
      authors: "Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova",
      publication: "NAACL-HLT",
      year: "2019",
      abstract: "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

      title: "Attention is All You Need",
      authors: "Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin",
      publication: "NeurIPS",
      year: "2017",
      abstract: "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.",

      title: "XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding",
      authors: "Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Quoc V. Le",
      publication: "NeurIPS",
      year: "2019",
      abstract: "With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy.",

      authors: "Akbar Karimi, Leonardo Rossi, Andrea Prati, Katharina Full",
      publication: "KI 2021: Advances in Artificial Intelligence",
      year: "2021",
      abstract: "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves the recognition of aspects and the classification of sentiment polarities toward them. Recent advancements in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have pushed the state-of-the-art in ABSA. This paper introduces ABSA-BERT, a novel approach that improves aspect-based sentiment analysis using BERT.",
